Welcome to the **GeeksforGeeks 160 Days Challenge** repository! 🎯

This repository is dedicated to storing solutions for the 160 questions in the GFG 160 Days Challenge. By solving these questions, you'll gain a strong grasp of fundamental concepts in programming, algorithms, and data structures, helping you excel in competitive programming and technical interviews.

## About the Challenge

The **160 Days Challenge** by GeeksforGeeks is designed to help students and professionals:
- Build problem-solving skills
- Strengthen core computer science concepts
- Prepare for technical interviews

Each day, a specific problem is assigned for you to solve, covering a variety of topics such as:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Trees
- Graphs
- Searching and Sorting
- And much more!

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
📂 GFG_160_Days_Challenge
├── 📁 Day_1
│   ├── Problem.md   # Problem statement
│   ├── Solution.cpp # Solution in C++
├── 📁 Day_2
│   ├── Problem.md
│   ├── Solution.cpp
├── ...
├── README.md         # This file
```

- **Problem.md**: Contains the problem statement, examples, and constraints.
- **Solution.cpp**: C++ implementation of the solution.
